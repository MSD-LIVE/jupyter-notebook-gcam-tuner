    "## Motivation\n",
    "Core GCAM assumptions are often to be regionally-uniform / long-term scenario assumptions.  The focus being on creating internally consistent scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at times, very specific assumptions or model outcomes are required.  Perhaps to harmonize with other modeling teams for a model inter-comparison project.  Or to match sponsor data and projections which will better align studies and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this has been true for some time.  And researchers using GCAM have been navigating this challenge, both at PNNL and in the GCAM community at large.  Thus we started by picking their brain on:\n",
    "* What are the projects?\n",
    "* What has the experience been like?\n",
    "* What are the variables / outcomes that need tuning?\n",
    "* What is the ”resolution” (spatial, temporal, sectoral, etc)?\n",
    "* What sorts of data sets are involved, are they open access or proprietary?\n"

    "## Defining a Tuning Target\n",
    "A tuning target can be quite generic.  At a high level it needs to identify parameters in GCAM that can be changed in a way that influences some GCAM outcome of interest.  Then evaluate how closely that GCAM outcome matches a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit more rigorously we require the following methods:\n",
    "* `initialize` - Do anything needed to start tuning this target.  It will be given an instance of GCAM in case threre is anything needed from a running GCAM instance.  In addition, we could imagine pulling information from external source or from `gcamdata` directly at this step.\n",
    "* `get_initial_tuning_params` - A vector of GCAM parameter values which will serve as a starting point in our parameter search.\n",
    "* `get_num_tuning_output` - The number of specific output values we will attempt to \"match\".\n",
    "* `set_tuning_params` - Take a current \"guess\" of parameter values and set them back into GCAM so that we can subsequently evaluate GCAM at those values.  Implicitly the size of this vector will match those returned by us in `get_initial_tuning_params` and it is up to the tuning target to \"map\" these values back into GCAM.  Most likely by using the `set_data` feature of `gcamwrapper` using the appropriate query.\n",
    "* `get_tuning_deviation` - Identify how well the current state of GCAM \"matches\" the desired outcome.  It is up to the tuning target to get the required information out of GCAM, likely using `get_data` with the appropriate queries, then aggregating / mapping and finally comparing to some desired outcome dataset.  Each value should be a percent difference of the current GCAM state from the desired outcome.\n",
    "* `export_to_xml` - Leverage data and tools from `gcamdata` to add the final solution parameter values into an XML add-on file which can be used in subsequent GCAM scenarios and analysis outside of the tuning framework."

    "## Implications for \"Core\" GCAM Scenarios\n",
    "Reflected in our survey of GCAM users on this subject was a desire to gather, organize, and maintain over time a database of, essentially, tuning directives and their related datasets.  Which can be applied and re-applied as GCAM naturally evolves over time.  Which will then be used to produce \"Tuned\" scenarios which are distrubuted as the GCAM defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage little progress has been made towards this request.  However, it remains an open area of thought.  As well as a natural place for collaboration with regional partners to improve modeling in specific GCAM regions. "
